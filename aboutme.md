My name is Ben Jefferies, from Flagstaff, Arizona.  Well, I'm actually <strong>from</strong> Kansas, but who can blame anyone for wanting to claim Flagstaff as home.

- I have a BA in Economics from the University of Kansas (2011)
- I also hold an Arizona teachers license and taught middle and high school math for many years.
- Currently I'm working on my MS in Program Evaluation and Data Analytics at ASU.
- I love generally being outside, but #1 is Rock Climbing
